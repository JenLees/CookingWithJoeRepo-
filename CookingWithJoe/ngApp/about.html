                    Hi, I'm Jenny and I'm a Trader-Joe's-aholic. A couple of decades ago I had my frist Trader
                    Joe's experience as a young woman at my local location in Fair Oaks, CA. I don't remember
                    my first product but what got me hooked was a spicy peanut snack mix. Oh how I miss
                    that spicy peanut snack mix.

                    I moved from Caliornia to Seattle, WA in 1999 and to my disappointment, there wasn't a
                    Trader Joe's store near me. But lucky for me one opened a few months after my move.
                    I started doing most of my weekly grocery shopping there and found I was eating healthier,
                    spending less money, and no longer dreaded the weekly drudgery of shopping for food.

                    Fast forward a decade. I had gotten married and my husband Shane was also a big fan of
                    Trader Joe's. He started coming up with great meals made from what we purchased there.
                    A few years ago he suggested we start a blog of recipes and products we love. Life of course
                    got in the way but now here it is. Our ode to Trader Joe's!
